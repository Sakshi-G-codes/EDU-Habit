# EDU-Habit
Daily Learning Tracker

EduHabit is a full-stack web application developed under the domain of Educational Technology and Productivity Tools. Its primary aim is to make self-learning more efficient, flexible, and motivating by integrating goal management with gamified progress tracking.

The system allows users (students) to:

-Create and manage personalized learning goals according to their subjects and schedules.
-Monitor their progress using daily streaks and progress bars.
-Earn motivational badges for maintaining consistency.
-Receive reminders and visual feedback to reinforce positive study habits.

From a technical perspective, EduHabit implements CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage user data and learning goals. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for seamless communication with the React.js frontend. Data persistence is managed through a MySQL database, ensuring secure and structured storage of user profiles, goals, and progress logs.

This project emphasizes an intuitive UI, a smooth user experience, and strong database integration to promote long-term learning discipline among students.
